# ExtractAPIElement

[COSTER](https://github.com/khaledkucse/COSTER) is a tool for finding the fully qualified name of the API element in online code snippets.

## Purpose
`CompilableCodeExtraction.java` is borrowed from the COSTER repository. 

The original COSTER version provides functions such as parsing source code to extract API element, but it can not identify whether the API element is declared (imported). The modified version is designed for the purpose of avoiding repetitive and useless test cases in the evaluation (eval) process.

## Usage
To use the modified version in this page, the user should replace the original code with this version.
The user can find `CompilableCodeExtraction.java` at `COSTER/src/main/java/org/usask/srlab/coster/extraction` (In the [COSTER](https://github.com/khaledkucse/COSTER) repository)

Run COSTER.main with program arguments.

The program will generate a csv file to store test cases that contain the information of API element, including the file path, the line number of the API element, the context of the API element, and the actual FQN of the API element.

## Example
Program arguments:
```
-f eval -e extrinsic -r data/code/ -j data/jars/ -d data/ -t 1 -m model/ -c cosine -n levenshtein
```

`data/test/testCode.java` 

`java.io.BufferedWriter` is declared

csv generated by the original version:

csv generated by the modified version:

As can be seen, API elements with FQN  `java.io.BufferedWriter` are removed.
